### Description: 
#### <p>The purpose of this project is to have an employee directory similar (not identical) to that of Homework 12. In reality, this is a repository of 100 randomly generated people via an API. This app contains a table with a picture, name, email, and phone number for each generated individual as well as a search bar to find an "employee" of choice. </p>

### Installation: 
#### <p>React is difficult. The hardest part was generating tables, something I still question the validity of. React breaks apart each element that would usually be on an HTML page. The good news is that REACT gives me some good starter code to work with that general applications do not and that I would have to build from scratch. It also gives me the advantage of interconnectedness between imported/exported pages.</p>
